# More context on the Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. The sequence begins as: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. Mathematically, it is defined as:

\[ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), \quad \text{with } F(0) = 0 \text{ and } F(1) = 1. \]

The Fibonacci sequence appears frequently in nature, art, and architecture.
